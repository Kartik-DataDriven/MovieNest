## Source Code

We've got the behind-the-scenes magic right here! 🎩✨ We've provided you with access to the source code that makes MovieNest tick. However, there's a little twist 🌀. To keep things organized, we've zipped the essential "model" directory, which was originally developed in a Jupyter notebook.

Inside this mystical "model.zip" folder, you'll find the heart of MovieNest:

- `movie_list.pkl` 🎥
- `similarity.pkl` 🎯

Now, here's the deal. GitHub has a size limit of 100MB for individual files, and our "raw" folder exceeded that limit. So, we've wrapped it up in a zip file, making it conveniently available in this repository.

To unlock the full magic of MovieNest, just follow these simple steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine 🧬
2. Unzip the `model.zip` folder ✉️
3. Get ready to embark on a movie adventure like no other! 🍿🚀

## Enjoy your MovieNest journey! 🪙
